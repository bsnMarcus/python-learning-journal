# python-learning-journal
A repository to document my Python learning journey

## About Me
My name is Marcus and I am going to be a sophmore at Homestead High School. Currently, my hobbies including gaming, and more importantly, music. I haven't had any experience with coding and this python course is my first time being exposed to any type of coding.

## Goals for This Course
My goals for this course are to understand basic python and to be able to write simple programs.

## My First Python Program
```beef
print("Hello World")
print("oh wow!")
```
